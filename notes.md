## Overview

- random variables
    - uncertainty vs. risk
- from histogram to distribution
    - commute to work example
- distributions (briefly explained)
    - normal distribution
    - uniform distribution
    - Poisson distribution
- logarithms(?)
- lognormal distribution
- explain distributions
    - mean (average)
    - standard deviation/variance
    - median
- calculate with distributions
    - $E[ax] = aE[x]$
    - $var(ax) = a^2 var(x)$
    - Steinerscher Verschiebungssatz
    - Bayes Rule! http://timharford.com/2016/03/how-to-make-good-guesses
- distributions (detailed with mean/variance)
    - show true distribution, and pick 10/100 random data
- correlation
    - correlation vs causation: show how a third data point can drive the first two correlations
- statistical difference/significance
    - show how two data dots come from the same distribution and can be different
    - t-test
