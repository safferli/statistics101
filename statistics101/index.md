## Statistics

> The practice or science of collecting and analysing numerical data in large quantities, especially for the purpose of inferring proportions in a whole from those in a representative sample.  
> [OED definition](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/statistics)


> Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.  
> Dodge, Y. (2006) The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms, OUP. ISBN 0-19-920613-9

<!--
* *Descriptive statistics*
involves methods of organizing, picturing and summarizing information from data.  
* *Inferential statistics*
involves methods of using information from a sample to draw conclusions about the population.

## Randomness

> The quality or state of lacking a pattern or principle of organization; unpredictability  
> [OED definition](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/randomness)

## History

- world's first statistics department at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics) in 1911
- born in WW2: [S-Branch](http://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21636589-how-statisticians-changed-war-and-war-changed-statistics-they-also-served)
- RNG back then: lottery balls, and women picking "random" 

<!-- The central office, the war cabinet was told, would produce "a regular series of figures on a coherent and well-ordered basis... that will be accepted and used without question". The new statisticians worked on government accounts; rationing (which ensured no Britons starved and greatly improved the diet of the poorest third); manpower surveys; the "pay as you earn"" system of taxation (which raised the cash needed to wage the war); and the Beveridge Report on social insurance that later led to the founding of the welfare state.

## Distributions

<!-- from histogram to distribution -->

### Histogram

### Density estimates

### Uniform distribution

### Poisson (Count) distribution

*** 

### Normal (Gaussian) distribution

## explain distributions

- most (nice) distributions can be explained by *moments*
    - mean (average)
    - standard deviation/variance
- for the Normal distribution: $$X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$$

## Bonus: Anscombe's Quartet

- Anscombe, Francis J. (1973) *Graphs in statistical analysis*. [American Statistician, 27, pp. 17â€“21.](http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/gerstman/StatPrimer/anscombe1973.pdf)
- four $x, y$ datasets which have equal properties:
    - mean, variance, correlation, linear regression
    - $$y = 4 + 0.346x$$
- showcase for data exploration!

## Correlation vs Causation

> (Statistics) A quantity measuring the extent of the interdependence of variable quantities.  
> [OED definition](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/correlation)

## Linear Regression

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_i + \varepsilon_i$$

- fitted values: $$\hat y = b_0 + b_ix_i$$
- residuals: $$e_i = y_i - \hat y_i$$

- statistical difference/significance
    - show how two data dots come from the same distribution and can be different
    - t-test
