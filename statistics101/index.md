## Statistics

> The practice or science of collecting and analysing numerical data in large quantities, especially for the purpose of inferring proportions in a whole from those in a representative sample.  
> [OED definition](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/statistics)

<!-- -->

> Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.  
> [The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-oxford-dictionary-of-statistical-terms-9780199206131?cc=de&lang=en&)

<!--
* *Descriptive statistics*
involves methods of organizing, picturing and summarizing information from data.  
* *Inferential statistics*
involves methods of using information from a sample to draw conclusions about the population.

## Randomness

> The quality or state of lacking a pattern or principle of organization; unpredictability  
> [OED definition](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/randomness)

## History

- world's first statistics department at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics) in 1911
- born in WW2: [S-Branch](http://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21636589-how-statisticians-changed-war-and-war-changed-statistics-they-also-served)
- RNG back then: lottery balls, and women picking "random" 

<!-- The central office, the war cabinet was told, would produce "a regular series of figures on a coherent and well-ordered basis... that will be accepted and used without question". The new statisticians worked on government accounts; rationing (which ensured no Britons starved and greatly improved the diet of the poorest third); manpower surveys; the "pay as you earn"" system of taxation (which raised the cash needed to wage the war); and the Beveridge Report on social insurance that later led to the founding of the welfare state.

## Distributions

<!-- from histogram to distribution -->

### Histogram


```r
# warning suppressed: non-finite values removed
dta.distance %>% 
  #filter(minutes < 120) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(x=minutes))+
  #geom_line(stat="density", aes(x=minutes), colour = "red")+
  xlim(0, 100)+
  labs(
    title = "Commute time of BB DUS employees", 
    y = NULL
  )
```

![plot of chunk commute-hist](assets/fig/commute-hist-1.png)

***

### Density estimates


```r
# warning suppressed: non-finite values removed
dta.distance %>% 
  #filter(minutes < 120) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(x=minutes, y=..density..))+
  geom_line(stat="density", aes(x=minutes), colour = "red")+
  xlim(0, 100)+
  labs(
    title = "Commute time of BB DUS employees", 
    y = NULL
  )
```

***

### Uniform distribution


```r
# x values for plotting
x <- seq(-5, 5, by = 0.01)

ggplot()+
  # normal distribution
  geom_line(
    aes(x=x, y=dunif(x, -4, 4)), size = 1.5#, colour = cbgPalette[6]
  )+
  labs(x = "", y = "", title = "Uniform distribution")
```

![plot of chunk uniform](assets/fig/uniform-1.png)

*** 

### Poisson (Count) distribution


```r
ggplot()+
  # normal distribution
  geom_point(
    aes(x=unique(as.integer(x)), y=dpois(unique(as.integer(x)), 2)), size = 3.5#, colour = cbgPalette[2]
  )+
  labs(x = "", y = "", title = "Poisson (Count) distribution")
```

![plot of chunk poisson](assets/fig/poisson-1.png)

*** 

### Normal (Gaussian) distribution


```r
ggplot()+
  # normal distribution
  geom_line(
    aes(x=x, y=dnorm(x)), size = 1.5#, colour = cbgPalette[6]
  )+
#   # lognormal distribution
#   geom_line(
#     aes(x=x, y=dlnorm(x)), size = 1.5, colour = cbgPalette[6]
#   )+
  labs(x = "", y = "", title = "(Standard-) Normal distribution")
```

## explain distributions

- most (nice) distributions can be explained by *moments*
    - mean (average)
    - standard deviation/variance
- for the Normal distribution: $$X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$$
    - $\mu = E[X]$
    - $\sigma = \sqrt{E[(X-\mu)^2]}$
    - $\sigma = \sqrt{E[X^2] - (E[X])^2}$

## Bonus: Anscombe's Quartet

- Anscombe, Francis J. (1973) *Graphs in statistical analysis*. [American Statistician, 27, pp. 17â€“21.](http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/gerstman/StatPrimer/anscombe1973.pdf)
- four $x, y$ datasets which have equal properties:
    - mean, variance, correlation, linear regression
    - $$y = 4 + 0.346x$$
- showcase for data exploration!

***


```r
anscombe.dta <- NULL
for(i in 1:4){
  anscombe.dta <- bind_rows(
    anscombe.dta, tibble(anscombe.set = letters[i], x = anscombe[, i], y = anscombe[, i+4])
  )
}

anscombe.dta %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x, y))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+
  facet_grid(. ~ anscombe.set)+
  labs(
    x = "x-values", y = "y-values", title = "Anscombe's Quartet"
  )
```

## Correlation vs Causation

> (Statistics) A quantity measuring the extent of the interdependence of variable quantities.  
> [OED definition](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/correlation)

***


```r
# correlation

cor.dta <- data.frame( 
  x = runif(100, min = 0, max = 10)
) %>% 
  mutate(
    a = x + runif(100, -1, 1), 
    b = x + runif(100, -1, 1)
  )

gg <- ggplot(cor.dta)+
  geom_point()+
  aes(x=a, y=b)+
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(x=NULL, y=NULL, title = "Scatterplot of A and B")
gg
```

![plot of chunk correlation](assets/fig/correlation-1.png)

***


```r
gg+
  geom_text(aes(x = 1, y = 9), label = "A=X+U[-1,1]\n B=X+U[-1,1]\n X~U[0,10]", hjust=0)
```

## Linear Regression

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_i + \varepsilon_i$$

- fitted values: $$\hat y = b_0 + b_ix_i$$
- residuals: $$e_i = y_i - \hat y_i$$


---

- statistical difference/significance
    - show how two data dots come from the same distribution and can be different
    - t-test
