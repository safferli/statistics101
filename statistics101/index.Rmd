## Statistics

> The practice or science of collecting and analysing numerical data in large quantities, especially for the purpose of inferring proportions in a whole from those in a representative sample.  
> [OED definition](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/statistics)

<!--
Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.
Dodge, Y. (2006) The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms, OUP. ISBN 0-19-920613-9

<!--
* *Descriptive statistics*
involves methods of organizing, picturing and summarizing information from data.  
* *Inferential statistics*
involves methods of using information from a sample to draw conclusions about thepopulation.

## Randomness

> The quality or state of lacking a pattern or principle of organization; unpredictability  
> [OED definition](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/randomness)

## Distributions

***

uniform

*** 

poisson

*** 

normal

## 

- explain distributions
    - mean (average)
    - standard deviation/variance
    - median
    - quartiles
    - Fehlerwartungen: avg vs median, Ver√§nderung der Betrachtung, steamspy Settlers data

- correlation
    - correlation vs causation: show how a third data point can drive the first two correlations

```{R correlation}
# correlation

cor.dta <- data.frame( 
  x = runif(100, min = 0, max = 10)
) %>% 
  mutate(
    a = x + runif(100, -1, 1), 
    b = x + runif(100, -1, 1)
  )

gg <- ggplot(cor.dta)+
  geom_point()+
  aes(x=a, y=b)+
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(x=NULL, y=NULL, title = "Scatterplot of A and B")
gg
```

***

```{R}
gg+
  geom_text(aes(x = 1, y = 9), label = "A=X+U[-1,1]\n B=X+U[-1,1]\n X~U[0,10]", hjust=0)
```

- statistical difference/significance
    - show how two data dots come from the same distribution and can be different
    - t-test 


Anscombe's quartet

---

```{R}
load("commute-distances.Rdata")

dta.distance %>% 
  #filter(minutes < 120) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(x=minutes))+
  xlim(0, 100)+
  labs(
    title = "Commute time of BB DUS employees", 
    y = NULL
  )
```
